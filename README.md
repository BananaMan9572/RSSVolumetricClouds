# RSSVolumetricClouds


EVE Config for RSSVE which adds Volumetric Clouds. Thank you Houndz for the initial help to porting this to RSS!

Note that the file names do not coorespond with the planet. Earth files are names Kerbin, etc. This will be fixed as much as it can, though cannot be fixed all the way until Volumetric Clouds are free.

Titan has not been completed yet, and isn't high on my to-do list. Please wait for them, or feel free to make your own!

HOW TO MAKE THIS CONFIG WORK:
1. Install Stock Voluemtric Clouds from Blackrack's Patreon (https://www.patreon.com/blackrack/posts) and inject it into Gamedata
2. Install the two config files, and put them in Gamedata/RSSVE/Configs/EVE_Configs/Clouds
3. Click allow to replace files in this location
4. Enjoy!
