# RSSVolumetricClouds


EVE Config for RSSVE which adds Volumetric Clouds. Thank you Houndz for the initial help to porting this to RSS!

Note that the file names do not coorespond with the planet. Earth files are names Kerbin, etc. This will be fixed as much as it can, though cannot be fixed all the way until Volumetric Clouds are free.

Titan has not been completed yet, and isn't high on my to-do list. Please wait for them, or feel free to make your own!

Refer to https://github.com/BananaMan9572/RSSVEVolumetricClouds/wiki for instructions on how to install the config.
